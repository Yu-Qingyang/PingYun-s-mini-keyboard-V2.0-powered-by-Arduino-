# PingYun-s-mini-keyboard-V2.0-powered-by-Arduino-
An Arduino Leonardo driven numeric keypad.Currently, the following functions have been implemented: 

0: Fully rely on Arduino, using the form of expansion board, low difficulty to achieve 

1: Single key backlight adjustable (using WS2812 led) 

2: very little IO port occupation (this scheme is different from the matrix keyboard, but the use of different diode array combination for key reading and writing) 

3: multi-mode adjustment, including fast filling C language C++ and other basic operation functions. 

4: Rich extensibility, you can write macros by yourself, control mouse and keyboard, and realize some Bad USB functions
